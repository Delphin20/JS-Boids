# Javascript, HTML5 Boids

A program I wrote to familiarize myself with JavaScript.

The simulation is drawn on an HTML5 canvas. The following parameters can be modified with sliders:
- Amount of Boids
- Speed
- Cohesion
- Separation
- Alignment

Simulation is based upon Craig Reynolds' [Boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) Principles

For the vector math I used the JavaScript 2D Vector Math Library [Common Vector Operations](http://www.cgrats.com/javascript-2d-vector-library.html)
